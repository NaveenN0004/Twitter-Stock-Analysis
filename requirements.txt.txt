os - For interacting with the operating system, such as creating directories.
time - For managing delays (e.g., when handling rate limits).
re - For regular expressions to clean text data.
textblob - For performing sentiment analysis on tweets.
sklearn (scikit-learn):
model_selection - For splitting data into training and test sets.
svm - For training the Support Vector Machine (SVM) model.
metrics - For evaluating model performance (accuracy, classification report).
preprocessing - For data scaling (StandardScaler).
deap - For implementing the Genetic Algorithm (GA).
base - For creating the basic components of the GA.
creator - For defining custom types in the GA.
tools - For using evolutionary algorithm tools like crossover and mutation.
algorithms - For running the evolutionary algorithm.
random - For generating random numbers (used in GA).
